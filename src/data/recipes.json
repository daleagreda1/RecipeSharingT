            "Instructions": "1. Put a large saucepan of water on to boil. 2. Finely chop the pancetta, having first removed any rind. 3. Finely grate both cheeses and mix them together. 4. Beat the eggs in a medium bowl, season with a little freshly grated black pepper and set everything aside. 5. Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add the spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente. 6. Squash the garlic with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it. 7. While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. 8. Keep the heat hot enough for the pancetta to sizzle, but not so hot as to burn the garlic. 9. Remove the garlic from the pancetta pan and discard. 10. Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. 11. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. 12. Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later. 13. Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. 14. Quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. 15. Use the tongs or a long fork to mix together, but do not stir it too much. 16. The heat from the spaghetti will cook the egg slightly, but not scramble it. 17. Serve immediately with a sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper.",
